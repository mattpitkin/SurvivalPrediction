# Bayesian Survival Analysis

This repository aims to test a Bayesian Survival Analysis for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. It is an attempt to 
replicate, or perform a similar analysis, to that in [Jochems _et al_, International Journal of Radiation Oncology, **99** 
(2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.04.021) using a MCMC methodology like that in the [PyMC3 Bayesian Survival 
Analysis example](https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/survival_analysis.html). The data from Jochems _et al_ is openly available 
[here](https://www.cancerdata.org/publication/developing-and-validating-survival-prediction-model-nsclc-patients-through-distributed).
